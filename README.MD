# Project Description

This project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate textual descriptions of images. It leverages a pre-trained vision-to-sequence model to analyze the content of an image and produce a detailed description in text form.

## How It Works

1. **Load Pre-trained Model and Processor**: The script loads a pre-trained model and processor from the Hugging Face model hub.
2. **Process Image**: An input image is loaded using the PIL library.
3. **Generate Description**: The image is processed, and a prompt is provided to the model to generate a descriptive text.
4. **Output Description**: The generated description is decoded and printed.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    ```sh
    pip install torch transformers pillow
    ```

2. Run the script with an image path:
    ```sh
    python vlm.py
    ```

## Example

Given an image located in iages folder, the script will output a textual description of the image content.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to catch and print exceptions that may occur during execution.
